# Nut

An application for serving Switch titles.

## Getting Started With Docker

> **Note about nut v2**
>
> Nut v2 no longer has a web gui, only the api works.

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

Once you run these commands, you should be able to visit `http://<your-ip>:9000`, username `guest`, password `guest`.

Force a scan using `http://<your-ip>:9000/api/scan`. By default, scans start between 0 and 30 seconds after interacting with `nut`, and typically take 10 seconds to 2 minutes depending on the size of your collection.

This is a modified version of [doctorpangloss/nut](https://github.com/doctorpangloss/nut)'s version.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=nut \
  --net=host \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -v </path/to/games>:/games \
  -v </optional/path/to/config>:/config \
  -v </optional/path/to/data>:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  jordond/nut
```

By default version the current latest version v2.3 of `nut` will be installed, you can override this by passing `--env VERSION=xxx`, like so:

```
docker create \
  --name=nut \
  --net=host \
  -e VERSION=v2.3
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -v </path/to/games>:/games \
  -v </optional/path/to/config>:/config \
  -v </optional/path/to/data>:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  jordond/nut
```

### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```
version: "2"
services:
  plex:
    image: jordond/nut
    container_name: nut
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
    volumes:
      - </path/to/games>:/games
      - </optional/path/to/config>:/config
      - </optional/path/to/data>:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-v /games` | Games should go here. |
| `-v /config` | Directory to copy default configuration files to. *Optional. It will be populated with defaults.* |
| `-v /data` | Directory to save various nut runtime files to. *Optional. It will be populated with images and other files nut needs to run.* |

## Optional Parameters

*Special note* - If you'd like to run nut without requiring `--net=host`, then you will need the following ports in your `docker create` command:

```
  -p 9000:9000
```

The application accepts a series of environment variables to further customize itself on boot:

| Parameter | Function |
| :---: | --- |
| `-e NUT_SCAN_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS=30.0` | At most one scan can run in the last number of seconds specified here. This image is configured to scan automatically whenever you connect to `nut`. |


## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```


&nbsp;
## Application Setup

There is a web UI at `<your-ip>:9000`. It will take some time to scan the titles, so be patient.

The default username and password is `guest:guest`. To change this, edit the `/config/users.conf` file.

## Docker Tips and Tricks

The rest of this document concerns running `nut` from a local directory on Windows, and portions of it are no longer up to date.

If the scanning takes too long, set an environment variable, `NUT_SCAN_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` to a greater number of seconds, like `999`, to prevent scanning from running too frequently.

To disable scanning, set the value of `NUT_SCAN_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` to `99999999999`.

Then, to force a scan, visit `http://<your-ip>:9000/api/scan`, and be patient!

## Information

This is a program  that automatically downloads all games from the CDN, and organizes them on the file system as backups.  You can only play games that you have legally purchased / have a title key for.  Nut also provides a web interface for browsing your collection.

You should copy nut.default.conf to nut.conf and make all of your local edits in nut.conf.

**If you only wish to rename / organize files, and not download anything, edit `nut.conf` and set all downloading options to false.** Your NSP files should have the titleid as a part of the filename in brackets.

It can download any titles you do not have a key for (for archiving), by enabling `sansTitleKey` in `nut.conf`.  These titles are saved with the `.nsx` file extension, and can be unlocked at a later time when a title key is found.
